# simulation check

Takes results from simulations done with MesoRD (http://mesord.sourceforge.net/) and
calculate the diffusion coefficients, occupancies and the dwell time of the different species. 

Also includes plot of occupancies over time, trajectories and histogram of coordinates.

The file example.py run the different functions for the simulation example.
